Is Tetra a puzzle or is it bubble-wrap?
If it's bubble-wrap, then it has colored sections which disappear when complete.

Only Update returns an error, NOT Draw or Layout
Boid's use of Vector2D
Spores should maybe belong to Puzzle, not Grid
Class for a collection of spores? Then could flock them
Input object that records mouse/touch state and has func Pushed() bool so things are triggered on mouse/touch up
location/storage of assets
Scale tiles to fit window
Save level state in a better place, currently it gets dumped in Home/Tetra?
expand colors.go to all web colors (will be useful one day)
