Is Tetra a puzzle or is it bubble-wrap?
If it's bubble-wrap, then it has colored sections which disappear when complete.

Only Update returns an error, NOT Draw or Layout
Input object that records mouse/touch state and has func Pushed() bool so things are triggered on mouse/touch up
Spores (map of Spore objects in Grid)
Generic interface for UI components (Button, Label)
location/storage of assets
Scale tiles to fit window
Save level state in a better place, currently it gets dumped in Home/Tetra?
expand colors.go to all web colors (will be useful one day)
color palette
