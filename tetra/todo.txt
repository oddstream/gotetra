If it's bubble-wrap, then it has colored sections which disappear when complete.

Only Update returns an error, NOT Draw or Layout
Dominos mode
Endcaps being clipped at edge of gridImage

Class for a collection of spores? Then could flock them
Input object that records mouse/touch state and has func Pushed() bool so things are triggered on mouse/touch up
