? Is Tetra a puzzle or is it bubble-wrap? If it's bubble-wrap, then it has colored sections which disappear when complete.
? Should this be a value, or a pointer to a value? Passing a value makes data immutable.

! In go, the idiomatic way to represent an empty and useless value is struct{}{}
! struct{} is a type, struct{}{} is an expression

Anonymous fields/embedding (blue book p144-6)
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2/vector (no line width or endcaps)
Rename Input (used by Label & TextButton) to Tap
Expand palettes
IsSectionComplete/IsCompleteSection
Use overloading
Only Update returns an error, NOT Draw or Layout
make Input smarter (using Pushable interface?)
Resize window (find a use for Layout)

Boid's use of Vector2D
Class for a collection of spores? Then could flock them
expand colors.go to all web colors (will be useful one day)

func SetWindowIcon()

Jigsaw mode
- tall screen Layout
- at start of level, top half fills with completed shapes, which then animate and rotate to random positions in lower half
- tap a tile rotates it, drag a tile to another slot
- upgrade Input to allow dragging
- animate tiles while dragging them
- tile states BeingDragged and Returning
- drag target must be a grid slot with coins == 0
- just one stroke will do, no need for map of struct{}{}

x Move the dragged tile to the front
x Convert Stroke to image.Point
x allow dragging tiles (prep for jigsaw mode)
x QuadraticTo() or CubicTo() curves when creating tiles
x Draw tilesheet using https://github.com/fogleman/gg
x https://www.cairographics.org/tutorial/
x use TileSize instead of TileSize, TileSize
x Flash of underlying shape when spores forming
x location/storage of assets
x Load Acme from acme_ttf.go
x Scaled tiles / Fixed tile size modes
x Input object that records mouse/touch state and has func Pushed() bool so things are triggered on mouse/touch up
x Save level state in a better place, currently it gets dumped in Home/Tetra?
x retire gridImage and send screen down heirarchy
x calc number of tiles across, down, and left, top margins
x retire Puzzle.go
- Spores should maybe belong to Puzzle, not Grid
x Endcaps being clipped at edge of gridImage
x Windows
x Decode png image from a byte slice instead of a file (https://github.com/hajimehoshi/file2byteslice)
x Grid (and main) background is palette average to hide the jaggies
x Try 100x100 tilemap (on 200x200 grid)
x Generic interface for UI components (Button, Label)
x color palette
x Shapes should alpha/scale in at start of level
x Spores (map of Spore objects in Grid)
x BUG Can click on a shrinking tile
x TextButton(text, font, command) class, font.BoundString()
x opening menu "do you prefer" "little puzzles" (no sections) or "bubble wrap"?
x BUG the mouse point his testing on the tiles is off to the left, draw some rects
x Separate Font.go (see 2048/tile.go)
x tilesheet with endcaps in overspill margin
x transition scale down of tile removal
x Cleanly tick over to NextLevel when something IsComplete after mouse in Grid.Update
x display level
x sections
